      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Madeleine Arrhenius. I grew up in Orange County, California,
        and later moved to Arizona during high school. I’ve always loved the ocean
        and staying active, especially through soccer, sand volleyball, and football.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and returned
        in March 2025 from serving a 1.5-year mission in Fort Worth, Texas. During my
        mission, I learned Spanish and gained experiences that helped me grow in
        leadership, communication, and adaptability.
      </p>

      <p>
        I chose marketing because it has interested me for as long as I can remember.
        I enjoy creativity, strategy, and learning how people connect with brands.
        As the oldest of five siblings, I’ve naturally developed a strong sense of
        responsibility and leadership.
